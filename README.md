## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Prediction
```python
from src.models.credit_model import CreditModel

model = CreditModel()
model.train(train_data)
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
```

### Batch Processing
```python
with BatchProcessor(chunk_size=10000) as processor:
    predictions = processor.predict_batch(large_dataset)
```
